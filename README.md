# Web Frameworks Exercises

This repository groups the coursework for my Web Frameworks class. Each subfolder contains exercises or sample projects that explore a different framework in the React ecosystem. All code here is experimental, intended for learning, and may evolve as the course progresses.

- **React.js/** – Core React fundamentals, component patterns, and state management practice.
- **Next.js/** – Server-side rendering, file-based routing, and data fetching exercises built with Next.js.
- **React Native/** – Mobile-focused labs covering native UI components and platform-specific behavior with React Native.

Feel free to browse the folders to follow along with the exercises. Since these are class assignments, expect a mix of completed tasks, in-progress work, and notes-to-self.
